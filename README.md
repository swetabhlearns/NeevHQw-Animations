# Project Name: Neev - Healthcare Technology (Clone/Prototype)

## Features

- **Entry Animation**: The page loads with animations on the first render to make the loading experience smoother.
- **Scroll Animations**: Sectional elements animate as you scroll, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience. These animations are currently missing and will be implemented in future updates.
- **Hover Animations on Images**: Images throughout the platform include hover animations to create a more interactive and visually appealing experience.
